# Tutorial: Add a venue 

Use the following steps to quickly add a new venue in **Local-Show-Tive**. You can perform these steps using [cURL commands](#add-a-venue-with-curl-commands) or in the [Postman application](#add-a-venue-in-postman).

You will have to use a command-line tool to complete the tutorial. If you are a first-time user, we recommend using Git Bash. If you use a different command-line tool, you may need to adapt the provided syntax for your tool of choice.

The tutorial will take about five minutes. 

_**Note:** This tutorial assumes that you have already completed the **Local-Show-Tive** getting started process. If you have not, complete the steps described in [Getting started](../getting-started.md), then return to this tutorial._

## Add a venue with cURL commands

1. In your preferred command line tool, start **Local-Show-Tive** locally by entering the following command:

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/local-show-tive/api
    json-server -w local-show-tive-source.json
    ```
    You must keep this window open for the remainder of the process.

2. In a separate window of your command line tool, type in the following POST command to create the new venue:

    ```shell
    curl -X POST {base_url}/venues -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Baltimore Soundstage", "city": "Baltimore, MD", "venue type": "indoor", "age restriction": "21+"}'
    ```
    _**Note:** When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`._

   You can change any of the `-d` response body values as you see fit. For more information, see the [Add venue reference](../references/post-add-venue.md).

4.  Run the command.

    The command line tool returns a message indicating that you successfully created the venue. The return message lists the new venue, the request body values you specified, and an automatically assigned `id` value.

5. To validate that the new venue was successfully added, run the following GET command:

    ```shell
    curl {base_url}/venues
    ```
   The new venue appears in the response body.

## Add a venue in Postman

1. In your preferred command line tool, start **Local-Show-Tive** locally by entering the following command:

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/local-show-tive/api
    json-server -w local-show-tive-source.json
    ```
    You must keep this window open for the remainder of the process.

2. Open the Postman app.

3. Create the following POST request; you will use it to create the new venue:

    ```shell
    POST {base_url}/venues
    ```
    _**Note:** When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`._

4. Click the **Body** tab.

5. In the **Body** menu, select the **raw** radio button.

6. In the space below the **raw** radio button, enter the following response body values:

   ```js
   {
   "name": "The Fillmore",
   "city": "Silver Spring, MD",
   "venue type": "indoor",
   "age restriction": "all ages"
   }
   ```
   You can change any of the response body values as you see fit. For more information, see the [Add venue reference](../references/post-add-venue.md).

8. Click **Send**. 

   Postman returns a `201 Created` message. The return message lists the new venue, the request body values you specified, and an automatically assigned `id` value.

9. If you want to validate that the new venue was succesfully added, run the following GET request in Postman:

   ```shell
    {base_url}/venues
    ```
   The new venue appears in the response body.
